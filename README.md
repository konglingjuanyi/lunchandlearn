# lunchandlearn
A sample SPA (Single Page Appilcation) web application. 
This is created using Spring MVC at server end and AngularJS at client.

To compile and host this application, you need to have JDK installed on our machine and JAVA_HOME properly set.

To compile the code, run following command from the project's home directory:

gradlew clean build

this should build the application.

To run the application, execute the following command from the home directory:

gradlew jettyRun

It starts a jetty server and hosts our web appilcation on it.
